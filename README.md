# Terra Station Kanban

![Banner](Kanban.PNG)

**Terra Station Kanban** Is a draggable kanban board purposefully built to be a seemlessly integration into the [Terra Station](https://github.com/terra-money/station) architecture. It follows design patterns and technolgies used as a means to be reusable and updateable by anyone familiar with the architecture.

Built as an inspiration from [Terra Screening](https://github.com/terra-money/screening-test-frontend/blob/master/README.md)

**Terra Station Kanban** is still in developement and will receive regular updates to improve user experience and additional functionality.

## Running Terra Station Kanban

Run Terra Kanban Screening with the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/HunterSides/terra-screening.git
cd terra-screening
